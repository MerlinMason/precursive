      This week, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RoadToDF14&amp;src=tyah">#roadtodf14</a> focused on the partners at Dreamforce, and how to make the most of your interactions with them whether you're a Salesforce customer or fellow partner. Leslie Tom, Adrienne Shimmel, and Dave Carrol starred to give their insights into how, as a customer, you can maximise your exposure and conversation with Dreamforce's 250 key partners, and they came up with this top 5 list:
      
      <strong>Visit the Cloud Expos</strong>
      
      According to Leslie, there are going to be a lot of surprises at the Cloud Expos, just what we can't quite say right now, but then again it wouldn't be much of a surprise if we could! There are two expos to explore, one north and one west, allowing you to see live demos and meet face-to-face with more than 350 cloud computing companies showcasing over 1,000 easy-to-integrate solutions. The north expo will feature the <em>product</em> showcase, allowing you to explore the complete Salesforce product portfolio from beginning to end and see how you can transform how you connect with your customers. The south expo will feature the <em>customer </em>showcase, which will allow you to experience first-hand how the world’s leading companies are using Salesforce to connect to their customers.
      
      <strong>Get immersed in the Zones and Hubs </strong>
      <p class="p1">The zones and hubs are a fantastic chance for you to experience what Leslie dubbed "the college experience" at Dreamforce. Leslie analogised going to Dreamforce as like going to a huge school of sales and marketing, with "seminars" taking place in these zones and hubs. This is where you will get that small, intimate experience with Salesforce professionals, allowing you to ask questions and get involved in sessions.</p>
      <strong>Visit the AppExchange area in the Platform Campground </strong>
      
      Marissa lifted the lid on some amazing stats about the AppExchange this week: 63% of customers have an AppExchange app; there are some 2,200 apps on the AppExchange, there have been over 2.2m installs handling 1.5b transactions a day, storing over 72b records. These are some impressive stats, and serve to demonstrate how the AppExchange community is constantly expanding, and how the platform is continually going from strength to strength. If you are interested in developing and application, or perhaps using one, this is a great place to go an interact with those partners who have direct experience in the AppExchange arena.
      
      <strong>Get Educated in 20+ AppExhange Sessions </strong>
      
      <a href="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Screen-Shot-2014-08-20-at-01.05.08.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-1644 size-medium" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Screen-Shot-2014-08-20-at-01.05.08-300x165.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-20 at 01.05.08" width="300" height="165" /></a>Leading on from this, Dreamforce is once again expanding it's number of sessions, this time in AppExchange education. If you want to become and partner and launch an application on the AppExchange, this is the place to come to learn all you need to know about AppExchange requirements and how to get your app rolling. This is also a great place to come if you're just launching on the AppExchange, and want to learn about releasing and marketing your app on the platform.
      
      <strong>Celebrate at the AppBash</strong>
      
      This year, the AppBash is going to be on Wednesday 16th October at City View, starting at 9pm. The biggest party at Dreamforce, this is a great place to get to know peers, partners and everyone else in a more relaxed and enjoyable situation. It's not to be missed!
