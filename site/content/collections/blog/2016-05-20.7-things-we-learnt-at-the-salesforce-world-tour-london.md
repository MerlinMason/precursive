      Yesterday was Salesforce’s annual World Tour in London, and the Precursive team was there in force to ensure we really got the most out of the day. After three years in attendance, Precursive CEO James Gasteen had some wise words of wisdom on the right way to attend, and even the uninitiated like myself realised that there are good ways to World Tour, and bad ways to World Tour.</p>
      <p>So, without further ado, here are the things we’ve learnt to ensure you get the most out of your day there.</p>
      
      ## How to World Tour well:
      <ol>
      <li>Wear comfy shoes. I can’t stress this enough. Whether you’re exhibiting or attending, you’ll be on your feet pretty much all day. Be kind to yourself – your body will thank you.</li>
      <li>Organise your meetings in advance and find a spot where people can find you. If you’re planning to conduct business or even just to catch up with some contacts, it’s helpful to have a predetermined space to meet. Fox Pub was the unofficial hub for Precursive and others!</li>
      <li>Don’t sell to people on the stands – they’ve paid a lot to exhibit and need to get their ROI, which is not from buying. Be considerate and use the tour as an opportunity to see what’s out there.</li>
      <li>Don’t pick up all the knick-knacks from the booths – those orange stress balls will only make their way to the attic!</li>
      <li>Get to sessions early – speakers are popular and seats go quickly. Give yourself enough time to be sure you’re not standing around at the back.</li>
      <li>Talk to as many people as possible. Everyone’s friendly and welcoming, and you never know where a conversation might lead!</li>
      <li>Practise your dance moves and be ready for the party boat! This is where the real fun happens – make sure you sign up comfortably in advance, as space is limited and spots go quickly!</li>
      </ol>
