      Profits on a project often slip away through inefficiency. In this series, we outline where these problems typically arise, and best practices to follow to ensure costs don’t run away from you.
      <h4>Host a Killer Kickoff Meeting</h4>
      If your project gets off on the wrong foot, it’s unlikely to meet objectives. People will always have different ideas, but ensuring everyone is in agreement and following the same plan and outlines from the beginning will make things infinitely easier.
      
      <strong>Agenda</strong>
      
      Before the meeting, send out an agenda. Outline the points you will cover and be clear what you need from each attendee. Who should be there? What do you need? What decisions will be made?
      
      <strong>Background</strong>
      
      Likewise, send out a background to the business and project before the meeting. Make sure everyone comes fully informed, so you can use the time to discuss, debate, and make decisions.
      
      <strong>File Storage</strong>
      
      Set up a file storage folder for your project, where all documents will be stored. It’s important to have one central place where everyone can go to find what they need. And it saves you having to track down the latest version of a file at 7pm on a Friday night!
      
      <strong>Personas</strong>
      
      People need to see the benefit and importance of the project on a personal and individual level, not just for the business as a whole. Think about the different personas in the room, and put yourself in their shoes - ask, what's in it for me? There should be a set of benefits that appeal personally to each person in order for them to be involved in the project. Make sure you add this to your plan and project communications. If people have nothing to gain, their input and attitude will be affected.
      
      <strong>Sponsor</strong>
      
      Ask your project sponsor to pre-front the meeting – whether you script what they say, or they do. You need to gain credibility within the team, and the best way to achieve this is from him or her.
      
      <strong>Plan</strong>
      
      Present the plan. Include dates and timelines, and resolve any issues now. You want to make sure that any queries are raised before the project gets underway, so that you’re not dealing with confusion or lack of responsibility later.
      
      <strong>Meetings</strong>
      
      Book in future meetings and regular project sessions before you leave the meeting. Some can be short conference calls, but some will need to be longer face-to-face updates. Make sure you book them in now – even if they have to change later, at least they’re in the diary.
      
      <strong>Next Steps</strong>
      
      Present clear next steps and action owners. Bring someone to take notes, clarify who’s doing what, and send out a summary afterwards. Make sure it is clear to everyone what they’re supposed to be doing and when: you want everyone to take ownership of their own responsibilities.
      
      <strong>Things to Avoid:</strong>
      <ol>
      <li>Getting bogged down in the detail. Discussions can easily be derailed into minute debates over something that is irrelevant for 90% of the people there. If this happens, suggest a breakout or that a subset of people meet to discuss it.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="2">
      <li>Over-reliance on email. Think about setting up a collective storage unit, e.g. dropbox, where you can store everything – you don’t want to be sending dozens of files out via email, and then having to resend when someone can’t find what they’re looking for.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="3">
      <li>Avoid using the session for collective reading. This is a waste of everyone’s time, including yours. Send out any materials in advance and inform everyone involved that they will be expected to have read everything sent and come prepared with questions or issues to raise on the subject matter.</li>
      </ol>
