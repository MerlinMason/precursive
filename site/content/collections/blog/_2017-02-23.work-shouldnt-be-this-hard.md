      In the current work environment a unique set of pressures has emerged that puts pressure on inviduals hitherto not seen before. The set of headwinds includes the age old adage of 'lack of time', demanding/upset/erractic customers, digital disruption, too much complexity and information overload.
      
      Being able to compartmentalise and focus on the right things as people and in business is more challenging than in the past.
      
      In the work environment, through in some politics and you have people that resemble the Tasmanian Devil in tailspin but is anyone actually getting anything done.
      
      Being 'busy' isn't cool. Work shouldn't be this difficult.
