      First up, an update on Apple’s ongoing standoff with the FBI. The US Justice Department <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/the-justice-department-says-apple-lied-2016-3">released a document this week</a> labelling Apple’s argument as ‘false’ and ‘corrosive’. Apple’s response <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/apple-doj-brief-response-2016-3">was an angry one</a>, and it seems tensions are rising. Apple doesn’t seem to be negatively impacted by the exchange, however; a <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3042153/ios/apples-brand-perception-unmoved-by-public-feud-with-fbi.html">poll by BrandIndex</a> found that public perception of the company has not been altered.
      
      Next, another update on something we’ve discussed previously: AlphaGo, Google’s AI computer, has this week taken on world Go champion Lee Sedol in a challenge to prove how far the AI technology has come. So far, <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-alphago-defeats-lee-sedol-in-second-match-ai-2016-3">AlphaGo has beaten Lee</a> in two of two games, and is in a strong position to win the three games it needs to be declared champion. This victory would be hugely significant in the world of AI, and many years of programming in the making.

      A lot’s happened in the world of hacking this week. For the first time, <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/mac-users-attacked-with-ransomware-2016-3">Macs have been attacked with ransomware</a> – although it seems Apple has already developed a fix. Amazon <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/amazon-to-bring-back-encryption-to-fire-tablets-2016-3">has reversed</a> its controversial decision to remove device encryption that we reported on last week, which seems apt given the security issues we’ve seen elsewhere recently. It appears that it’s now even easier <a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/03/06/hacking-a-phones-fingerprint.html">to hack fingerprint sensors</a>, and that you can even <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302150023.htm">hack 3D printers</a> by recording printing sounds.
      
      In lighter news, Hilton has <a href="http://www.psfk.com/2016/03/hilton-concierge-robot-connie-ibm-watson.html">introduced its first robot concierge</a>. The robot, Connie, works in a Hilton hotel in Virginia to greet guests and answer questions about the hotel and local area. Connie’s knowledge and capabilities are expected to improve over time, as she interacts with more guests and learns through experience.
