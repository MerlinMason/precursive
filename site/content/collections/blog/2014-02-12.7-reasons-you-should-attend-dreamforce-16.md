      If you’re at all involved with Salesforce, you’ll probably have heard of Dreamforce, the annual conference held in San Francisco each Autumn. One of the biggest technology conferences in the world, last year Dreamforce had 150,000 attendees, and this year looks set to be even bigger. With a not-to-be-sniffed-at price tag though, it can seem like a large investment for ‘just’ a conference. So, aside from the possibility of <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/salesforces-dreamboat-for-dreamforce-2015-9">staying on a cruise ship</a>, why should you attend?
      <ol>
      <li>
      <h5>The Keynotes</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      Dreamforce speakers are always inspiring, and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/keynotes/">this year is no exception</a>. As well as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff – who has championed important causes in his career, particularly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/07/marc-benioff-indiana_n_7017032.html">this year</a> – keynote speakers include Melinda Gates, of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and Patricia Arquette, Academy Award winning actress and Activist – as well as a few NASA astronauts. Because why not.

      <ol start="2">
      <li>
      <h5>Networking</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      In case you missed the number, last year Dreamforce had 150,000 attendees. 150,000. With representatives from a range of industries and a huge variation of job roles, you’re bound to find someone you’d like to do business with.
      <ol start="3">
      <li>
      <h5>Solutions</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      One of Salesforce’s biggest strengths is that it’s not just a piece of software: it’s the gateway to a whole ecosystem. There are thousands of solutions that work with Salesforce to solve a range of business needs – some you wouldn’t even have imagined could be linked to a CRM. Dreamforce’s Cloud Expo showcases this, and gives you the opportunity to talk to experts in the field about the problems you’re experiencing.
      <ol start="4">
      <li>
      <h5>Training</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      As well as all the tips and tricks you’ll pick up at sessions throughout the event, Dreamforce offers specific Salesforce training at a special rate. Plus, with so many experts on hand, you’ll be spoilt for choice if you choose to ask for help.
      <ol start="5">
      <li>
      <h5>The Parties!</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      At any event described as ‘<a href="mailto:https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathewguiver/what-is-dreamforce%3Futm_term=.whke4PO85%23.ntDAVxklb">Burning Man with WiFi’</a>, you can expect there to be a lot of fun. As well as the AppBash and partner parties, Dreamforce boasts its very own Dreamfest with live music performances. Last year’s headliners were the Foo Fighters, so who knows what’s in store for this year?
      <ol start="6">
      <li>
      <h5>Philanthropy</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      Salesforce has long been known for its integrated philanthropy approach following the 1-1-1 model. Last year, Dreamforce attendees donated over 1 million books to schools around the world. This year’s charities haven’t yet been announced, but you’ll know you’re supporting a good cause as well as having fun.
      <ol start="7">
      <li>
      <h5>Ideas</h5>
      </li>
      </ol>
      And finally, the real reason most people attend Dreamforce: to get real, actionable ideas on how to improve their use of the software and grow their business. <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2016/05/convince-your-boss-dreamforce-16.html">96% of surveyed attendees said their business improvements outweighed the cost of attendance</a>. You’ll have a fantastic time, and you’ll come back ready to hit the ground running.
      <h5>Bonus Point: The weather’s got to be better. Surely.</h5>
      If, like us, you’re staring out of your London office window lamenting the appalling state of the tube network due to today’s weather, the thought of getting out of the country and taking your chances with the precipitation an 11 hour flight away sounds pretty appealing – right??
