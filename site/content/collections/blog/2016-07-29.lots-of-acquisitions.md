      The surprise tech news this week has been <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/oracle-to-buy-netsuite-for-9-3-billion-1469708380">Oracle’s acquisition of Netsuite</a>. The deal poses a conflict of interest question, given that Oracle’s chairman Larry Ellison is also the majority shareholder of Netsuite, but Oracle is known for its acquisitions and the two businesses have similar offerings.
      
      Meanwhile, Oracle competitor (and Precursive partner) <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/25/salesforces-benioff-says-he-would-have-paid-more-than-26b-for-linkedin/">Salesforce has revealed</a> that it would have outbid Microsoft in the deal for LinkedIn.
      
      And of course, the tech acquisition that’s been expected for months was confirmed this week: <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/verizon-acquires-yahoo-2016-7">Verizon is to acquire Yahoo</a> for $4.83 billion. And in the past couple of weeks, <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/yahoo-hiring-spree-after-verizon-deal-2016-7">Yahoo has posted almost 300 job listings</a>. Yahoo is certainly undergoing a lot of change at the moment, and it will be interesting to see the direction the company takes following the acquisition.

      In security news, website <a href="http://www.nomoreransom.org">www.nomoreransom.org</a> has <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/afp-police-cyber-firms-tackle-ransomware-hacking-threat-2016-7">been launched</a> to help slow the growth of ransomware attacks. The site aims to educate users on how to avoid ransomware attacks, as well as providing keys that could solve the problem if a computer is hacked.
      
      And finally, Pokemon Go is still causing a storm: <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/pokemon-go-most-download-app-in-apple-app-store-history-2016-7">it has broken App Store records</a> for the most downloads in its first week. Pokemon Go users are actually <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/people-are-spending-way-more-time-on-pokemon-go-than-facebook-snapchat-2016-7">spending more time on the game than on Facebook and Snapchat</a>, and businesses are cashing in on its popularity for their own benefit. Local businesses are using lures – in-game items that attract Pokemon to an area – to bring in customers, and offering Pokemon-themed discounts. The game’s popularity has not waned yet, but Niantic will have to fix its server issues and bring out the demanded game developments soon if it wants to keep users as hyper-engaged as they are now.
