      In the 1984 classic, the Karate Kid, Daniel Larusso learns from his mentor, Mr Miyagi, that the secret to Karate and also life, lies in the mind and heart not in the hands. Here at Precursive we are big fans of 80s movies and being able to draw tenous (but nevertheless effective) links to how to achieve more effectiveness in the workplace. In our experience, if you wish to achieve workflow bliss in your business then you need to win hearts and minds and the best way to do this is not with your fists!
      
      For anyone who works in a company where you rely on delivering a great customer experience then all too often you may find yourself in a state of perpetual frenzy. Why? Because for many it is entirely too difficult to answer some simple yet fundamental questions about the underlying mechanics of how their business runs. For project based businesses like consultancies, creative agencies, telecoms or high tech firms - rates of growth are driven by your ability to leverage your people as effectively as possible. In the words of a CEO for one of our clients, "Our most valuable asset goes down in the lift at the end of each day."
      
      How can it be that the most simplistic of questions such as "Who is available?" or "How is that project going?" - are often the most difficult to answer?
