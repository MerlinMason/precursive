      In conversations with various businesses, we see the same issues crop up time and time again. There's one area we're going to focus on in particular today: the problems caused by a lack of close plans in sales.
      
      So what are some of the key challenges sales teams encounter? How are some of the best companies navigating this environment more effectively?
      <h4><strong>What are the problems?</strong></h4>
      <strong>Close dates pushed back month over month.</strong> Aside from the problems this causes with sales cycles and cost of sale, it’s difficult for the rest of the business to adapt to. How can you prepare for a project if you’re not sure where it’s going to land?

      <strong>Last minute requests for pre-sales support.</strong> This often results in a dash to get a demo or technical knowledge out, and can cause the quality of a bid to be impaired.
      
      <strong>Top delivery talent being pulled into sales too early.</strong> Some of those pre-sales or consulting resources are pulled into sales when they don’t need to be there. Not only is this not beneficial to the sale and a waste of time for everyone involved (even potentially delaying the sale), those delivery people are being taken away from revenue-driving billable work. Any cross-departmental help should be planned, and justified.
      
      <strong>Deals close last minute with no lead-time into delivery.</strong> This obviously does not work from a planning perspective. The Operations component is squeezed, and there is a mad rush to staff a project. Everyone gets stressed and upset, and the project is less successful because the people who ideally would have been on the project have already been allocated elsewhere.
      
      <strong>Tension between sales and delivery occurs.</strong> A poor, manual handover results in mistrust between the teams. The operations team is in charge of giving the client what they paid for, and without sufficient briefing or preparation time, this can go drastically wrong.
      <h3><strong>How does this impact your business?</strong></h3>
      <strong>Inaccurate revenue forecast.</strong> This is really key in businesses that run these types of projects. There’s a high cost rate, so being able to predict when these deals will land is hugely important. Uncertainty really eats into departmental as well as business profit and loss.
      
      <strong>It absorbs company time.</strong> Lack of sufficient planning means a very manual process, which takes staff away from revenue-driving work.
      
      <strong>Inefficient resourcing.</strong> The lack of lead-time between sales and delivery makes it impossible to resource efficiently. Last minute deals with short lead times risk pulling key resources from stable projects. Over-commitment to the client affects deals and project quality as a whole.
      <h3><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></h3>
      <strong>No close date.</strong> There's no qualifying urgency, and an insufficient understanding of the buying organisation, procurement process and lead times. Without this, it’s impossible to have a clear idea of when a deal will close.
      
      <strong>Last-minute close.</strong> This is caused by a poor understanding of customer sign off, and not communicating a plan with delivery.
      
      <strong>Requesting last minute support.</strong> Lack of planning means an inability to guide the customer through the education of your product or service.

      Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on how you're managing your sales team - all of these issues stem from the same source. Next week, we’ll cover how to address these with a close plan, and what that plan should look like.
