      Although tools such as Precursive (arrange a demo <a title="Free Trial" href="http://www.precursive.co.uk/features/signup/">here</a>) make online timesheets much easier, we know lots of people want to do it themselves.
      
      Fortunately, building a basic online timesheet that offers basic hours calculation is easy using <a title="Google Docs" href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>, which is free for small companies to use and great for storing cloud-based data.
      
      <strong>1. Getting started</strong>
      
      When you're preparing an online timesheet for yourself, you'll have to consider a few of the following things to make sure the solution will work for your needs:
      <ul>
      <li>How will users be completing their timesheet - online via the web (Google Docs is great for this), on mobile (for this you might want a more mobile-ready solution) or on paper for entry manually (Excel, which is marginally faster than Google Docs, might be better here).</li>
      <li>How you'll report on the information - do you need to run reports regularly? What type of reports? Does everybody need access to this functionality? If your reporting requirements are in-depth, you may wish to use a more advanced solution.</li>
      <li>How secure the data needs to be. For small companies, the password protection offered by Google Docs should be fine. Larger organisations will want the enterprise-grade data security offered by providers such as Salesforce.com.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>2. Setting up the template</strong>
      
      Once you've thought about the requirements, it's time to dive in. Fire up Google Docs (<a href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com</a>) and visit the template gallery to find timesheet templates. As it's not always publicly linked from the front page, the easiest way to do this is to paste '/templates?q=timesheet&amp;sort=user&amp;view=public' after your main Google Docs URL (so the full URL is probably going to look like "https://drive.google.com/a/yourcompany.com<strong>/templates?q=timesheet&amp;sort=user&amp;view=public</strong>").
      
      Select the doc template you want to use and click 'Use this template' to duplicate it into your Google Docs folder.
      
      Note: we selected the second Google Doc Template (<em>Monthly Employee Timesheet by Hours with Calculations</em>), a great resource by Shimmy Weitzhandler which can handle overtime and basic wage calculations, although you may want to explore the others (they're free).
      
      <strong>3. Customise</strong>
      
      Shimmy Weitzhandler's template is set up in a one-page-one-employee format, which makes it dead easy to set up.
      
      <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-481" src="https://precursive.com/assets/media/template-1024x581.png" alt="template" width="940" height="533" />
      
      Enter all your company information in the top green box (making sure to set the right month and year) and then click the little arrow at the bottom next to 'Sheet 1' to duplicate the sheet. Do this as many times as you need for different resources - it's also worth renaming the sheets for the name of the employee you'll be tracking.
      
      <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482" src="https://precursive.com/assets/media/people.png" alt="people" width="472" height="70" />
      
      The dates are automated and will recalculate depending on the month and year chosen - the only caveat is that data stored in each line isn't automatically wiped. So you'll want to back up this document using 'Make a copy...' from the File menu at the end of each month, before going in and changing the date to reflect the next month, as well as wiping the values from the previous month in each timesheet:
      
      <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483" src="https://precursive.com/assets/media/makeacopy.png" alt="makeacopy" width="298" height="127" />
      
      Then you'll have a file by month. It's a little manual work, though for a basic online timesheet it shouldn't take too long. An automated cloud-based solution like Precursive would take care of this for you though.
      
      <strong>4. Share</strong>
      
      <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484" src="https://precursive.com/assets/media/share.png" alt="share" width="109" height="55" />
      
      Once this is done, you'll be able to click the blue 'share' button to send the online timesheet to everyone in your organisation - enter a message with basic instructions on how to choose the tab with their name on it, and which hours should be entered.
