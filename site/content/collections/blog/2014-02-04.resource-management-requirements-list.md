      Any software purchase benefits from a requirements list. Whether it's necessary to outline your needs for a custom implementation, or whether it's just to help you identify priorities when comparing vendors, having a structured list of the capabilities your business is looking for goes a long way towards a successful transition.

      This example requirements list outlines the capabilities businesses typically ask for when looking to purchase resource management software. The table also allows you to rate each requirement based on the impact it will have to your business, so you know which items to prioritise when it comes to making decisions.
