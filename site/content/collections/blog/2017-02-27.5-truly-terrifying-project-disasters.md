      <strong>Scary scope creep in USAF</strong>
      
      <strong></strong>Poor requirements gathering appears to have been at the route of this nightmarish tale. After spending over $1bn the USAF decided to scrap the Expeditionary Combat Support System, citing concerns over the project’s progress. It was probably a wise decision - a review of the project, which was intended to replace over 200 legacy systems, determined that it would take until 2020 and cost another $1.1bn just to complete a quarter of the original scope. Ouch.

      <strong>The horrible health service fiasco</strong>
      
      An ill-fated attempt to upgrade the computer system used by Britain’s integrated National Health Service is one of the world’s best known IT fiascos, which started back in 2002 and still rumbles on. Current best guesses suggest costs are hovering around the £10bn mark. Originally designed to put all patient records in one place, it was hit by technical problems and contractual disagreements, before ending up as one of the most expensive contracting disasters in the history of the UK public sector.

      <strong>FoxMeyer’s fiendish folly</strong>
      
      Once the 5th largest drugs company in the US, the demise of FoxMeyer is widely cited as the world’s worst IT implementation disaster. The project started in 1993 as a fairly small (by the standards of a $5bn company) $65m investment in an ERP system (SAP, if you must know) designed to computerise its supply chain and projected to save the company $40m a year. Both the planning and implementation of the project was an unmitigated disaster - by 1996, FoxMeyer had filed for bankruptcy protection, saddled with additional implementation costs and significant inventory losses as a result of the system.

      <strong>Canada's ghoulish gun registry</strong>
      
      The Canadian Firearms Registry, intended to license gun owners and require the registration of all firearms, was a disaster in both cost and (according to some groups) efficacy. Politically contentious from the outset, the project was beset by delays and cost overruns. It was originally estimated that taxpayers would only need to pony up $2 million for the annual budget - now estimated to be around $66.4 million for the 2010-2011 financial year. Some estimates suggest the program has cost $2bn to date — and despite all that, a partial scrapping of parts of the law that enacted it in the first place is now under consideration.
      
      <strong>The chilling case files</strong>
      
      <strong></strong>The FBI’s effort to update paper case files with a sophisticated computerised network should have been simple enough - but lack of a strong blueprint and scope creep meant that the first effort, codenamed Virtual Case File (VCF) and undertaken between 2000 and 2005 failed miserably. A new project, Sentinel, began in earnest soon afterwards in an attempt to clean up the mess but was also troubled, eventually deploying in 2012 - over a decade after the upgrade program had originally started. The final bill for the two project is estimated at well over a billion dollars.
