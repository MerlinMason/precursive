      Today we’ll look at building a resource management schedule, in the second part of our ‘five steps to success’ guide to a resource management implementation (for the first part, see <a title="Resource management team – the first step towards implementation" href="http://www.precursive.com/blog/resource-management-team-the-first-step-towards-implementation/">here</a>).
      
      A schedule adds a layer of formality to the resource planning process that may feel unnatural to some business at first. Stick with it though, because if you’re not operating a proper schedule, getting the right inputs and outputs for a successful implementation is much, much harder.

      Most businesses we work with operate on a weekly cycle,which is already a significant departure for some. Legacy enterprise businesses we’ve worked with often operated with a month-long resourcing cycle, which meant getting actionable data on resourcing required a considerable lag. In one case, reports on resourcing weren’t available until two weeks afterwards, leaving management permanently behind the curve when it came to decision-making and encouraging on-the-ground team leaders to make short-term decisions that weren’t always in the best interests of the business.
      
      Fortunately, cloud-based integrated software means that this needn’t be the case anymore - real-time data is available for project managers and executives at a click of a button, as long as the processes are in place to collect that data.
      
      So what do those processes look like on a calendar as a formal resource management schedule? Well, most companies start with Friday as a logical place to request timesheets from colleagues, which makes sense. Timesheets should be submitted weekly to encourage maximum accuracy, and the sign off process (if required) should happen the same day. The resourcer, with the help of a line manager, is responsible for ensuring timesheets are completed and submitted on time.
      
      Resourcing planning meetings for the week ahead can also be conducted on a Friday, after timesheets have been collected. It’s advisable for project managers to have made any resource requests the day before (Thursday), so that a resourcer can schedule the coming week and further out with confidence.
      
      After the weekend, reports on the previous week and the week ahead should be generated and passed around the business for review. In our experience, executive teams prefer a Monday-morning view of the week ahead, giving them plenty of time to monitor the situation throughout the week and raise issues with schedulers ahead of Friday’s planning meeting.
      
      In our previous post, we discussed the position of the reporter - in our target scheduling process, we expect this person to spend at least a few hours running reports and liaising with management to ensure the right data is being provided in a timely fashion.
      
      Tuesday and Wednesday, in case you’re wondering, are pretty empty resource management-wise for many of the businesses we work in - activity is concentrated at the end of each week. Of course, each business operates in a different way and there’s certainly no prescriptive solution, but we do find that the above schedule works for the majority of our clients. If you have a different system, we’d love to hear about it.
