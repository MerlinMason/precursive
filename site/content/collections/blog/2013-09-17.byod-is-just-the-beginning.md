      We’ve spent a lot of time building out our mobile software offering in recent months. All this thinking about how we embrace a mobile-first future got us thinking about the future of ‘Bring Your Own Device’, a policy that has become widespread in corporate environments as CIOs struggle to incorporate our new attachment to our personal devices with the corporate work environment.
      
      BYOD is a nice concept - it’s been picked up on by most companies as a way to encourage employees to become more connected and work more on their own terms, with the happy side effect that it generally increases the number of hours an employee is reachable.
      
      What’s important to remember though is that BYOD isn’t the end story. In fact, it’s only the start. Our workplace is transforming and the workforce is changing - we’re moving away from an office-based cadre of workers towards a more flexible, responsive structure based of permanent, temporary and freelance staff, working from wherever is most convenient for them.
      
      <![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-907" alt="1105261_38986856" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/1105261_38986856-1024x757.jpg" width="940" height="694" />
      
      Frame BYOD in this argument, and it’s easy to see that the current paradigm - where employees use their own devices to access a corporate network — is actually fairly short-sighted. In ten years time, there may not even BE a corporate network to access. And the implications of that are scary for today’s IT department. Because if there’s no physical network, there’s really no need for PCs connected to it.
      
      In a world of almost limitless connectivity offered by fast, cheap 4G cellular networks, the idea of mobile devices as something secondary to a primary ‘work device’ just doesn’t work. Instead, a new future, where primary work devices are mobile seems more likely. This, according to Gartner, suggests that companies will need to adapt their ways to allow people to choose their own vendor. Using a current example, one employee might choose to use an iPad, the other a Nexus, and it will be IT’s responsibility to make sure everything works everywhere. That job will doubtless be complicated by the proliferation of mobile devices, including phones, tablets, cloud-based laptops and likely others.
      
      For us as cloud software vendors, this is an easy future to imagine, and probably to adapt to too. It requires us to continue building apps available across all devices, sure, but we’ve already embraced the idea that people will be accessing our services wherever they are - it’s kind of critical (and yet oddly overlooked) in time sheeting software. It’ll continue to guide us towards apps such as our<a title="Resource management software for iPad – register today!" href="http://www.precursive.co.uk/resource-management-software-for-ipad-register-today/"> forthcoming iPad app</a>, which replicates almost all of the functionality of the desktop app, rather than just a small chunk of it.
      
      For everyone else, it’s a future that may require some more reflection. The software decisions made ten years ago still affect businesses today, and the world will change faster in the next ten years than it did in the previous. So when a real-time, collaborative, remote and interconnected cloud powers the enterprise, what will your ‘network’ look like?
