      When you're running projects, there's a lot of data that you need to get hold of. Profitability metrics, timesheet data, KPI performance... It can be overwhelming, and difficult to identify what top priorities are. As Head of Professional Services, what information should you absolutely have access to?
      <ol>
      <li><strong> Who’s in my team?</strong></li>
      </ol>
      We’re not just talking about names here – although that will certainly help – but the skills and knowledge of those individuals. What certifications do they have? What experience do they have? What software are they familiar with? Which clients have they worked with? What languages do they speak? All of these facts – and more – should be readily accessible to you, in order to assign the most appropriate people to your projects.
      
      To go one step further, great Professional Services Directors will know what projects their team members <em>want</em> to work on. What skills do your consultants want to acquire? Which clients do they enjoy working with? How do they want their careers to develop? If you can also address these wishes where possible, you’ll end up with happier consultants – which, of course, means happier customers. Win-win.
      <ol start="2">
      <li><strong> Who’s available?</strong><strong> </strong></li>
      </ol>

      This one is pretty key to running a professional services division. If you don’t know who’s available, how can you allocate them to projects? You should be able to see a clear overview of all of your team at a glance, and identify immediately who is free to work on a project.
      
      And this goes further than just seeing who is available to work on a particular project. If you have clear knowledge of your team’s workloads, you can see whether they’re under or over capacity. If somebody isn’t working to capacity, you want to know so you can assign them to a project. If someone’s double-booked or over-capacity, you want to know ASAP so you can find alternative arrangements before it’s too late. Utilisation is key to professional services project margins, so getting this right could mean the difference between a profitable project and an unprofitable one.
      
      <ol start="3">
      <li><strong> What’s going wrong?</strong></li>
      </ol>
      Things can go wrong. People get ill, technical issues abound, scope grows past what's deliverable – these all happen, and not infrequently. Make sure you're made aware of them as they happen. You want to know that if anything messes up, you’ve got the time to fix it. This includes making sure that there’s a system in place for your team to report issues to you as quickly as possible.
      
      Plan for issues in advance: don’t wait until the end of a project, when it’s too late!
