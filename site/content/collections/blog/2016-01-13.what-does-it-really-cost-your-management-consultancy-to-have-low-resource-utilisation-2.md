      Management Consultancy continues to be a rapidly growing industry and is looking at a 7% growth for 2013-2014 according to <a href="http://bit.ly/1nFJHqt">IBISWorld</a>. But without careful resource management any revenue growth will be offset by a haemorrhaging of money - and the culprit: Utilisation!
      
      Every project manager knows that Utilisation is an important metric, but we are constantly amazed at how few companies accurately track and actively work to improve their Utilisation.
      
      Considering how much time executives put into tracking ROI on their financial systems, CRM and Marketing efforts, its odd that careful resource management (where the true margin for a project is won or lost) is not common practise.
      
      In another article we’ll look at why this might be, and its a combination of technology factors, awareness and time constraints.
      
      Here though, we’re going to look at the <b>real</b> cost of not keeping track of Utilisation and how it is pouring management consultancy profits down the drain.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Utilisation</strong>
      
      As a quick reminder, Utilisation is the ratio of your team’s chargeable time to their available time. High Utilisation means that you have a higher project margin, as more people are on billable projects and the time spent on non-billable work is lower. That part is simple, and we won’t go into too much detail on how to work it out, but have a<a href="http://bit.ly/1qYsFTB" target="_blank"> look here for more on Utilisation</a> if you're interested.
      
      <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1276" alt="Utilisation Equation" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Screen-Shot-2014-03-20-at-09.13.54.png" width="288.0" height="60" />
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <b>How much is it <i>really </i>costing you?</b>
      
      Let’s say for simplicity that your Management Consultancy makes a nice round £100 on a project when an individual consultant is fully charged-out for a day.
      
      Now, we know from the companies we work with that for a relatively small consultancy, a project’s revenue will roughly break into thirds - 1/3 will go to fixed overheads, 1/3 to the salary of the consultant, and 1/3 is leftover as margin. In this case that means £33 on overheads, £33 on salary and £33 for profit.
      
      When revenue decreases, your profit margin for that project is the thing that suffers - as overheads and salary will not change. The same goes for if revenue increases and everyone knows this.
      
      What is frightening though is that businesses spend so much time trying to get the sales team moving to push up that revenue, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without considering the Utilisation at all</span>. Here’s why that’s so dangerous:
      
      If a consultant’s Utilisation goes down by just 10% on that £100 project, because maybe they were doing non-billable admin work, then the billable work in that day becomes £90. Their salary stays the same, the overheads stay the same, and that missing £10 comes right out of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> bottom line.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <em>This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">30%</span> reduction in your profit simply because the consultant’s time was not carefully scheduled.</em>
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Can you afford this?</strong>
      
      Just imagine how that scales up when you think of your own project revenues, how many billable consultants you have and how well utilised your team really is.
      
      Understandably, this is a huge concern for a lot of MCs. They work so hard to close new deals whilst keeping marketing and deal acquisition costs down, but the margin leakage from poor utilisation puts a spanner in the works.
      
      Without a thorough understanding of where your people are and what they’re doing, you will find it extremely difficult, time consuming and draining to keep on-top of your utilisation and work to improve it, and all too often it just gets swept under the rug or brushed off as an unavoidable cost.
      
      But ultimately, the effect on your bottom line will stunt your growth if it's not corrected.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <b>How to fix it?</b>
      
      Let’s give you a plan-of-action for how you’re going to take control of your utilisation and help bring up those project margins again so that you <i>know </i>your growth is better supported and you’re not getting margin leakage.
      
      &nbsp;
      <ul>
      <li><em>First - </em>Do the above calculations for your business and find out the real cost of poor utilisation for you. We’ve built a handy <a href="http://bit.ly/1qYiKNT" target="_blank">Utilisation Calculator</a> to get you started.</li>
      </ul>
      &nbsp;
      <ul>
      <li><em>Second -</em> start asking questions about your resource management process. How long does each step take? How are time sheets completed and approved? How are team members allocated to projects?If you can see more than one area that feels old-fashioned or clunky then there’s your first hint as to what’s wrong - HINT if you’re still using Excel then you may be in trouble (<a href="http://bit.ly/1qYt4W9" target="_blank">see why</a>).</li>
      </ul>
