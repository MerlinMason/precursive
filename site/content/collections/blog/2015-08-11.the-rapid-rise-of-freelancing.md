      <p>Yesterday the Financial Times published an article entitled “Digital platforms draw freelancers from fringes of global workforce”, here Precursive discusses the topic.</p>
      
      
      <p>Recently it has become clear that there is an increasingly rising level of casual labour (primarily with mobile and web development) around the world via platforms such as <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank">Upwork</a>, which provides a marketplace for freelancers to find work. Upwork has been especially popular with Ukrainians, with more than 120,000 of them looking for work via their platform and earning a whopping $61m dollars (from mainly western companies) in 2014.</p><p>Platforms like Upwork make it easier for anyone regardless of their background to get work and they allow people to get work based on their skill-set as opposed to their formal qualifications. For those who are financially disadvantaged yet have made advantage of increasingly available free online learning resources, it means they are able to acquire the same skills as a normal graduate and possibly start earning sooner than them. Furthermore working from home relieves those who are geographically displaced from the worry of being uprooted and eliminates the cost of day-care for those with children.</p><p>With flexibility being one of the top <a href="http://www.precursive.co.uk/five-things-people-managers-should-consider-when-hiring-a-millennial/" target="_blank">priorities for millennials</a> it is no surprise that freelance work is an attractive option; furthermore the increasing popularity of co-working spaces means that there is no longer the fear of being alone all day.</p>

      <p>However, with the freedom of working alone comes the lack of support from an employer, especially at the tail ends of one’s career. In corporations one can expect to be trained up for the job they are to take on. For those doing freelance work on the side of having a temporary job, they are less likely to be paid for their training in that job than someone in a permanent role. We were interested to learn how a 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that “only 58 per cent of temporary workers had had training paid for by their employer in the previous three months, compared with nearly three-quarters of permanent workers”. In addition, although it may not be a current consideration for most self-employed people, pensions can prove troublesome. According to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/11174288/Self-employed-Youre-stumbling-into-pensions-nightmare.html" target="_blank">this</a> article “self-employed people who miss out on a lifetime of employer contributions forgo an average of £91,500 in company pension scheme contributions, according to research by Prudential”.</p><p>To freelance or not to freelance? For the many people out there who are relentlessly searching for a traditional job, the idea of working independently may be scary…is a life of freedom with freelancing worth the uncertainty of income and lack of a “nest” to shelter in? Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p><p>Read the whole article <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/6a23a27c-3500-11e5-b05b-b01debd57852.html#axzz3i8MOBBv4" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
