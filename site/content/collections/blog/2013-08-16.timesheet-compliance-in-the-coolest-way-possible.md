      This Friday, absolute kudos goes to <a title="Mando Group" href="http://www.mandogroup.com/" target="_blank">Mando Group</a>, a software house in the UK that appears to have finally cracked the timesheet problem we've <a title="Five late timesheet policy ideas to try in your business" href="https://www.precursive.com/blog/late-timesheet-policy/" target="_blank">blogged so much about</a>.
      
      Their timesheet completion is at an all-time high following the installation of a fridge that's filled with cold beers and other treats - but it only opens when everyone's timesheets are complete.
      
      The fridge is hooked up to their in-house online timesheet system, company consultant <a title="Andrew Greenyer" href="https://twitter.com/AGformby" target="_blank">Andrew Greenyer</a> explained to me, which requires that timesheets are completed on a daily basis.
      
      "In order to improve buy-in to time management and monitoring what we are doing for each client, we needed to up the completion rate, which is why Matt Stephens, Learning &amp; Development Manager came up with the idea of the fridge as a way of encouraging the team," said Andrew.
      
      Creating a hall of shame of people falling behind in completing their timesheets is visible to all, so allows for some banter and encouragement from the rest of the organisation.
      
      The idea is already a success, with completion of this week's timesheets at an all-time high of 92 percent -- and six more hours to go before the fridge may or may not open.
      
      Those who are standing between the majority of the staff and a delicious cold drink are named and shamed, a <a title="Timesheet completion at an all-time high" href="http://www.mandogroup.com/timesheet-completion-at-all-time-high/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the company's website states, with performance broken down into teams and displayed as a neat infographic.
      
      So, hats off to Mando Group and well done for implementing the most enjoyable timesheet compliance tool we've seen so far!
