      Earlier this week, Precursive CEO Jimmy Gasteen presented at the TechMeetupsGuru programme on the topic of selling to the enterprise.
      
      At the end of the presentation, he was asked about the resources he’d recommend startups read on the topic - the answers were two books and a blog:
      
      - <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/" target="_blank">Both Sides of the Table</a> - a blog by entrepreneur turned VC Mark Suster
      - <a href="http://www.predictablerevenue.com" target="_blank">Predictable Revenue</a> - the seminal sales guide from Aaron Ross, widely credited with cracking the enterprise market for Salesforce.com.
      - <a href="www.thechallengersale.com" target="_blank">The Challenger Sale</a> - a study in how great sales reps challenge their customers
      
      I’ve a fan of all three and would recommend them all - especially Mark Suster’s blog, which contains great advice, insightful stories and some pretty honest admissions that few bloggers have the experience or guts to share.
      
      
      I’ll also add some of my favourite sources to the list, and invite you to do the same in the comments below - hopefully we can make this post a great repository for enterprise sales source material.
      
      Joanne Black’s blog at <a href="http://www.nomorecoldcalling.com" target="_blank">http://www.nomorecoldcalling.com</a> has some thought provoking posts if you can endure the constant exhortations to buy her book.
      
      Marketo’s blog is worth scanning, especially the Sales Marketing Alignment section: <a href="http://blog.marketo.com/" target="_blank">http://blog.marketo.com/</a> (in my view it’s far superior to Hubspot’s insanely popular blog)
      
      Jill Konrath’s Fresh Sales Strategies blog: <a href="http://www.jillkonrath.com/sales-blog/" target="_blank">http://www.jillkonrath.com/sales-blog/</a>
      
      Finally, from a startup perspective, Patrick McKenzie (@kalzemeus) has blogged extensively on selling, conversion optimisation, SEO, enterprise and lots of other things software entrepreneurs need to know: <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/" target="_blank">http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/</a>. <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/05/23/selling-your-software-to-businesses-twiliocon-2012-presentation/" target="_blank">This</a> video on selling to the enterprise is particularly noteworthy for smaller firms.
