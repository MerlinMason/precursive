      The big social media story of the week has been <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/08/02/facebook-instagram-snapchat/">Instagram stories</a>. Facebook-owned Instagram has copied the feature directly from Snapchat, where it has proved immensely popular. Facebook itself is working on growing ad revenue, as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/facebook-is-testing-video-ads-during-live-broadcasts/">tests video ads on Live broadcasts</a>. It has also <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/facebook-changes-news-feed-algorithm-to-limit-clickbait-2016-8">announced changes to the News Feed algorithm</a> to combat click bait – which I’m particularly pleased about, as clickbait is a pet peeve of mine.
      
      Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, has <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-comments-on-oracles-93-billion-netsuite-deal-2016-8">stated that he’s not too impressed</a> by the recent acquisition of Netsuite by Oracle. He believes the move is part of a drive for Oracle to be the first to reach $10 billion revenue in the cloud, a race <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/microsoft-takes-lead-in-the-race-to-10-billion-in-cloud-revenue-2016-8">Microsoft is currently leading</a>. Salesforce has made a new acquisition of its own this week, largely because <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-really-likes-quip-ceo-bret-taylor-2016-8">Benioff wanted to work with Quip’s CEO</a>.
      
      There have been a couple of high-profile hacks this week: <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drops-12-exchange-hack-amplifies-price-decline/">Bitcoin hackers stole roughly $60 million</a> via a security breach, causing prices to decline. Yahoo has also allegedly been hacked, with a hacker <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/yahoo-supposed-data-breach-200-million-credentials-dark-web">advertising 200 million user credentials on the dark web</a>.
      
      The App Store <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/apples-app-store-just-had-its-best-month-ever-and-its-probably-because-of-pokemon-2016-8">has had its best month ever</a>, largely due to the phenomenal rise of Pokemon Go. There have been several complaints about the game – due to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/pokemon-go-niantic-fixing-capture-rate-glitch-2016-8">frequent bugs</a> and the <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/pokevision-creator-fires-back-at-niantic-over-pokemon-go-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">shutdown of third-party websites</a> – but it’s still <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/pokemon-go-players-are-in-open-revolt-but-the-game-is-more-popular-than-ever-2016-8">proving immensely popular</a>
