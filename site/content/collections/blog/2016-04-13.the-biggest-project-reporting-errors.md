      Reporting is important because the regular project report gives everyone visibility of progress and issues, and the opportunity to resolve any issues. <a href="http://www.theaccessgroup.com/resources-downloads/whitepapers/data-visualisation-for-project-management/">The Access Group</a> found that businesses identified ‘capturing time/costs against projects’ as their biggest project management challenge.
      
      So what are some simple things you can do to improve the integrity of your reports?
      
      <strong>Collaboration</strong>
      
      Choose collaboration tools (e.g. Slack or Dropbox) that avoid the project team having to send round latest versions of working documents, or errors being reported due to the wrong file being shared. Share them all in the agreed place and update them in the relevant folder. Ensure that relevant parties are notified when files are updated, or that weekly updates are sent out if this is more appropriate.

      <strong>Simple Report</strong>
      
      Develop a simple report that can be emailed out on a regular basis. This file should be controlled by just one person so that there are not duplicate versions floating around. The report should be a simple document that no one needs to log in to view, to ensure that the maximum number of people see it.
      
      <strong>Key Criteria</strong>
      
      Understand from the client what the key criteria for the project are. Ensure this list features prominently in your reports and summaries.
      
      <strong>RAG Rating</strong>
      
      If you’re using a RAG rating, ensure that the client team has seen the report before you send it out and that they’re in agreement with the measures you’ve selected. Don’t send out an update that has something on a red status without informing the client team first – it’s a sure way to make some enemies.
      
      <strong>Things to Avoid:</strong>
      <ol>
      <li>Overcomplicating your reports by reporting on everything. Those who read your report will just want to see a general summary of the metrics that matter. Keep it simple and easy to understand.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="2">
      <li>Trying to hide bad figures. If a project’s going badly, it can be tempting to be less open with the figures you report, particularly if you feel that you might have a chance to ‘catch up’ before the following report. Don’t. The earlier potential problems are highlighted, the sooner they can be resolved.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="3">
      <li>Not having an escalation method. If in your report you come to realise that something is awry, make sure there is a system in place to report this to more senior stakeholders who can take action.</li>
      </ol>
