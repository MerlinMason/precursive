      Salesforce have taken lots of steps to help create a development enviroment which seemlessly works with modern development tools like GIT (Version control), really powerful CLI (Command line interface) to manage development workflows.
      
      Wade Wegner (VP & PM of SalesforceDX) showed a really quick example of how opensource components can be used in the Lighntning Page builder in a few seconds. Using some components built by [Appiphony](http://www.lightningstrike.io/).

      One thing we found really exciting was a new concept of - scratch orgs - where a developer can quickly fire up a new org and replicate a clients org settings in seconds and test a new feature. This will make development at Precursive so much easier.
      
      As we're concentrating on migrating our product to [Lightning](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) (A whole new version of Salesforce) these tools are all great.
      
      We're excited to have just signed up to be on the pilot of [Salesforce DX](https://developer.salesforce.com/platform/dx).
