      The Red Herring editorial team selected the most innovative companies from a pool of hundreds from across Europe. The nominees are evaluated on 20 main quantitative and qualitative criterion: they include disruptive impact, market footprint, proof of concept, financial performance, technology innovation, social value, quality of management, execution of strategy, and integration into their respective industries.
      
      Finalists for the 2016 edition of the Red Herring 100 Europe award are selected based upon their technological innovation, management strength, market size, investor record, customer acquisition, and financial health. During the months leading up to the announcement, Red Herring reviewed over 1200 companies in the telecommunications, security, cloud, software, hardware, biotech, mobile and other industries completed their submissions to qualify for the award.
      
      The finalists are invited to present their winning strategies at the Red Herring Europe Forum in Amsterdam, April 11-13, 2016. The Top 100 winners will be announced at a special awards ceremony on the evening of April 13 at the event.
      
      Unfortunately, Precursive CEO James Gasteen is unable to attend the finals due to family commitments, but we are thrilled to have been shortlisted and wish the best of luck to the other finalists!
