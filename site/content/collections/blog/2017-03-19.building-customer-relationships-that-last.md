      It’s not three-month-old babies that keep me awake at night. It’s the continuous focus on the
      short term.

      Sir Martin Sorrell knows his onions, you don't get to the top and stay at the top for as long as he has without knowing proverbial onions. What is his greatest worry?  What does he believe will have the greatest negative impact on future growth? The answer... Short-termism.
      
      Now take a moment and think about this issue. Have you seen this happen in your company? Ever had a manager, you could describe that way? Maybe you worked at a public company that thought that way and acted accordingly come end of quarter if things weren't where they needed to be?!?!
      
      We would imagine it is actually quite a common topic for many. Perhaps we don't like to admit it but maybe this mindset or approach happens ALL THE TIME.
      
      So what does this mean for us as individuals and the businesses we manage or work in.

      Please give some thought to your top 10 customers. Got the list in your head? OK, now write down on a piece of paper these things:
      
      1) How would you describe your relationship with each customer in one word
      
      2) In your last three interactions with the customer, which of the following most applied:
      
      a) relationship building
      b) planning for growth
      b) firefighting
      c) an escalation
      d) other
      
      3) What's the lifetime value of this customer to your company?
      
      
      
      ere at Precursive we have a saying which is this: Being busy isn't cool
