      ARM Holding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/17/arm-holdings-confirms-softbank-is-buying-the-chip-designer-for-24-3b-in-bold-iot-move/">is to be acquired</a> by SoftBank. It is set to remain headquartered in the UK, and Softbank plans to double ARM’s UK employee base. SoftBank has particularly expressed interest in ARM’s investment in the Internet of Things, and this is likely to see considerable development over the next few years.
      
      Salesforce has weighed in on the Android fragmentation issues by announcing that by the end of the year <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/7/18/12217580/salesforce-support-nexus-samsung-galaxy-android-fragmentation">it will only be providing support for</a> certain Google Nexus or Samsung Galaxy devices. Android’s fragmented approach has been criticised in the past, as it causes security issues and makes it difficult for developers to test for different platforms. It wouldn’t be surprising if other app developers followed suit behind Salesforce.

      Google’s DeepMind, however, is doing well from its expansion into different areas. It has revealed how the AI is <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-ai-in-every-company-data-centre-end-of-year-2016-7">being used to reduce energy</a> consumed by Google’s data centres by 15%. DeepMind is also expanding its relationship with the NHS, and <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-is-going-to-start-meeting-nhs-patients-at-its-london-office-2016-7">plans to hold quarterly meetings</a> with patients to ensure they are involved with the developments.
      
      Snapchat is potentially moving in a new direction with regards to user security. It <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/new-snapchat-patent-uses-facial-recognition-tech-protect-privacy-photos-blurring-emojis-2016-7">has filed a patent for facial recognition technology</a> that could prevent sharing of a picture if the subject hasn’t given permission. What’s interesting about this is that there have been considerable objections to facial recognition technology in the past on the basis that it could be a breach of privacy; this time, the tech is being used to enhance it.
      
      Pokemon Go is still a raging success, finally <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36842259">launching in Japan today</a>. The game has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/nintendo-market-value-doubles-on-pokemon-go-mania">doubled Nintendo’s value</a> since its release, leaving one strategist to say that he’d ‘never seen the trend of such a big company’s shares changing so quickly in such a short period of time’. Linking such a popular brand to augmented reality in the mobile market has paid off, and it seems likely we’ll see developments in the future.
