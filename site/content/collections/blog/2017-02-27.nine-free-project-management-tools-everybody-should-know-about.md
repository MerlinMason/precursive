      Cloud tools have revolutionised project management, freeing us all from the tentacles of Microsoft Project and ushering a new age of collaboration when it comes to running things smoothly. One of the greatest changes has been the easy availability of free, high-quality project management tools - there are so many to choose from, it's difficult to know where to start. We've picked out the following nine, which should be enough to get most project managers started - take a look, check out the links and let us know what you think!
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-724 aligncenter" alt="imgres" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/imgres.jpg" width="161" height="121" /></p>
      <strong>Asana</strong>
      <a href="http://www.asana.com" target="_blank">http://www.asana.com</a>
      
      A shared task list for a team, Asana is a pretty flexible to-do tool which can be grouped cleverly to make it suitable for almost any task. Users can create, assign and follow tasks, communicating through a shared inbox that aims to make project-based emails a thing of the past. Basic milestone functionality is included, but the real strength of Asana is in its team management features, which significantly increase the visibility of team members using the software. Those who like to work fast will appreciate the keyboard shortcuts, a popular differentiator.

      <strong>Azendoo</strong>
      <a href="http://www.azendoo.com" target="_blank">http://www.azendoo.com</a>
      
      Azendoo is similar to Asana - a to-do list tool with excellent collaboration features, although it has some pretty cool plugins that allow it to be used with other services such as Dropbox, Evernote and Google Docs. Again, the focus here is on reducing email overhead and improving team communication by efficient sharing and organisation of information.

      <strong>Basecamp</strong>
      <a href="http://www.basecamp.com" target="_blank">http://www.basecamp.com</a>
      
      Basecamp's project-per-page format has made it something of a hit for creators 37 Signals - one page contains discussions, to-do lists, files and documents related to a project. Then, projects are organised into one 'board' so you can see everything from every project at once. People can be assigned to groups and also to projects, so there's also some basic resource management in there.
      
      <em>Update: Basecamp appears to have discontinued its free plan, although it's still available by Googling, mysteriously...</em>

      <strong>Do</strong>
      <a href="http://www.do.com" target="_blank">http://www.do.com</a>
      
      Now owned by our platform partner Salesforce.com, do.com offers advanced task-based tracking for projects with handy templates for those projects and tasks which appear over and over again. Do.com places a strong emphasis on social functionality, with chat, groups, notes, contacts and activity feeds making the whole experience very familiar to social network users. Unsurprisingly, the app comes with Salesforce.com integration so that it can be linked with a CRM.

      <strong>Evernote</strong>
      <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">http://www.evernote.com</a>
      
      Evernote's already in the arsenal of most people who need to remember the important details - it's a streamlined way to collect documents, text, images, web links and anything else you collect while browsing. However, its organisation potential is contained in the individual notebooks, which can be infinitely customised to collect important project-related information. This is especially useful if you've got pen and paper notes which need collecting and sharing with the team. Any one who's ever tried to comb a massive Sharepoint repository to find a particular file will love this tool.

      <strong>Gantter</strong>
      <a href="http://www.gantter.com" target="_blank">http://www.gantter.com</a>
      
      Gantter is a web-based project management tool somewhat akin to Microsoft Project. It can best be described as a 'lite' version of its Microsoft cousin, but its real power comes from its Google Docs integration. This way, it almost becomes the missing project manager in the Google Docs suite - an entire team can collaborate on a comprehensive project plan, with the Gantt chart and day-planning features that will be familiar to Project users.

      <strong>ProductEev</strong>
      <a href="https://www.producteev.com/" target="_blank">https://www.producteev.com/</a>
      
      Producteev is a 'social task management' solution which deserves kudos for trumpeting its free credentials - it promises on its site that it's free. forever. One interesting differentiator from Asana and Azendoo is the powerful API, which allows plenty of customisation for those with the coding chops to make it happen.

      <strong>Trello</strong>
      <a href="http://www.trello.com">http://www.trello.com</a>
      
      We primarily use Trello to manage our sprint, but it's also used by marketing and sales teams for collecting items such as opportunities or upcoming events. This is the beauty of Trello - its simple "noticeboard" structure of items placed on various boards makes it incredibly easy to customise to individual processes. If you're looking for something simple and low-overhead, Trello's the one for you.

      <strong>Zoho Project</strong>
      <a href="http://www.zoho.com">http://www.zoho.com</a>
      
      Zoho's whole suite of tools contain almost everything a manager could need, but Zoho Project is what we'll focus on specifically here. Designed to manage from 'thought to finish', the one-page framework makes for a speedy centre where teams can plan for, chat about and store information on multiple projects. The mobile app means easy access on the go too.
