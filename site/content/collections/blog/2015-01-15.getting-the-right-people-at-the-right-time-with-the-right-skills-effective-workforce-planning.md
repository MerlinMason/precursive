      Picture this, you’ve just been assigned to lead a new project that involves a number of prestigious clients... Great news but before you get too ahead of yourself, you’re now left with the daunting task that others inevitably face; getting the right people, at the right time, with the right skills integrated into your team.
      
      We believe that there are many aspects that can play a big part in making these decisions. However, we at Precursive, think there are 3 in particular that you should think long and hard about. After-all, the chosen team members make up the thin line between project success and failure, ultimately shaping even your own future. So when faced with finding project resources, here are our top tips:
      
      <strong>1) Experience</strong>
      
      Although an obvious factor, experience can be key in understanding if the consultant can potentially adapt to the project you have to offer them. Are they familiar doing similar work before? Have they worked with these clients before? Experience can go a long way in differentiating who might be a better fit for the project. Quite simply, it is riskier to choose someone with similar skills and traits but with less experience because there is a chance of a dip in quality thus, a decrease in utilisation. However (and there is a however), <strong>everything must be relative</strong>. Every aspect of the consultant’s experience has to be relevant for the work that you’re project will require. It may sound simple but you wouldn’t believe the amount of companies we speak to who make the assumption that experience in one field must mean experience in others too. However, relevant experience is key.

      <strong>2) Skills</strong>
      
      A New Inconvenient Truth</a>, a skills-based culture is upon us. This means that more and more people are being judged and rated based on their actual specific skills rather than their titles and qualifications. Companies are starting to regard employee outputs as much more important than their inputs. Despite this, we see in so many cases where just because someone might be ‘higher qualified’, they are assumed to be the right person for the project. <strong>Be specific, claw deeper</strong>. There is a very unique skill-set needed for each individual project and so having the right people with those specific skills is an absolute must.
      
      <strong>3) Project Values</strong>
      
      So, you now have a list of consultants that have relevant experience and the specific skills needed to make this project a huge win. What could possibly go wrong now? The answer is a lot, if matching their value is disregarded. Even though your consultants now look brilliant on paper, you need to make sure that they would fit perfectly into the culture you want to adapt and your own leadership style. Therefore, you need to match their value. Will they adapt well in this environment? Do they offer a different perspective on the project? How will they interact and integrate with other team members? When you have ticked all the boxes of the <strong>relevant experience</strong>, with the <strong>right skills</strong>, matched with the <strong>project’s needs</strong>, you have a <strong>real</strong> consultant on your hands.
      
      So, it sounds like a very lengthy, time-consuming process doesn't it? Not necessarily. Not with the right tools. So yes, like said above, there is a very thin line when choosing resources as they determine whether a project succeeds or fails, but with Precursive, that line really doesn’t have to look dangerously thin. In fact, it starts to look rather thick. Rather thick indeed.
