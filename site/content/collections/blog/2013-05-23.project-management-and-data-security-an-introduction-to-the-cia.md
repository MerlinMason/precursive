      #When was the last time you thought about project data security?
      
      This week, Precursive will be taking to the stage at the Global Security Challenge Prize, a place for promising young companies to showcase the "next generation of protection for our data and ourselves."
      
      The Prize is a worthy one as it forces us all to think about data security with the specific context of small, agile organisations, where it is all too often forgotten - and there are some interesting parallels here for project managers, who have spheres of responsibility that share some key similarities with these small organisations.
      
      For various reasons, many small firms and startups don't address security issues -- in the rush to build a product and meet sprint deadlines, spending development time on security often feels like an unnecessary distraction, particularly if there are no users to be worries about when the application is being designed.

      For project managers working to tight deadlines, some of this thinking may seem familiar - who has time to worry about project management data security when there is so much more to be done, when resources are already so stretched and the deadline or go-live date seem so close? Good security practice abounds in large companies, but project teams and contractors, often working outside more established structures on short-term projects, tend to get forgotten.
      
      Both smart startuppers and smart PMs know that this approach is a risky one though. When security issues to eventually surface, retrospectively fixing them is many times harder. Often, it requires making compromises and the potential for a disrupted team, delayed deadline or messy user experience is - self-evidently - much higher.
      
      In the enterprise, the requirement to think data security from the outset is actually fairly useful - many of our clients, for example, won't touch software that doesn't meet their minimum requirements for the safe storage and access of data. That means that security was architectured from the outset - we're heavily reliant on our platform partners, Force.com, who provide a secure, enterprise-ready environment we can leverage.
      
      For everyone else, the basics should provide the starting point for getting project teams to think about project management data security regularly in your organisation. The 'CIA' triad is the oft-quoted guiding principle in information security - it refers to the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of your data and is a useful way for project managers to approach the topic. Read through the examples below and consider how the explanations and examples given could impact your projects -- and whether there's anything you could do to mitigate the risk.
      
      <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
      
      Do you limit data access to only those who should be able to access it? Can data be disclosed to an unauthorised individual? Making sure that payroll data remains siloed from developers, for instance, is a good example of how confidentiality can be maintained. Access controls are key - locking down the various parts of your project to those who who need it is a good first step.
      
      Next, think about encryption to ensure confidentiality is extended to those outside of your organisation. If data is carried on thumb drives, make sure it's encrypted into ciphered data that can't be read.
      
      <strong>Integrity</strong>
      
      Integrity is critical for IT projects, where the sanctity of data is paramount. It normally refers to ensuring that the data you have hasn't been and can't be tampered with - protecting against viruses or damaging hackers, for instance.
      
      Integrity can be compromised in various ways. Data passing to and from a website, for example, has to have integrity ensured from transit level upwards - using SSL connections, secure WiFi and cross site request forgery protection are all ways to ensure that information isn't tampered with en route.
      
      For project managers working within repositories, one way to enforce integrity is to consider a system which hashes key files (on Sharepoint this is achievable using an event handler) and therefore alerts when an MD5 hash differs from the original.
      
      <strong>Availability</strong>
      
      Availability ensures that data and systems are up and operational when they're needed - and needs to be analysed carefully to ensure that malicious entities can't exploit downtime, when other safeguards may be unavailable.
      
      Project managers can ensure availability by using fault-tolerant systems hosted in the cloud, where redundant servers are on hand to take over in the event of a loss. Force.com, for instance, ensures that Precursive clients benefit from 99.9% uptime, with data centers with backup, failover and disaster-recovery. Other organisations used to handle business-critical information, such as SharePoint and Huddle, will provide their own uptime guarantees and failover safeguards.
      
      If moving out of the cloud, project managers can ensure availability by making secure backups, server clusters and alternative sites, ready to take over if a location becomes unusable.
