      To celebrate the launch of our new resource management app for iPhone (get a free trial <a title="Free Trial" href="http://www.precursive.co.uk/features/signup/">here</a>), we thought we’d take a look at some of the other project management solutions available in the Apple App Store.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Merlin</strong>
      
      Anyone who’s used Merlin for the desktop will know how handy it is for planning out what you’re working on - it’s an OS X favourite for many. This app is a handy iOS companion - you’ll have to pay to move things across to a desktop server, but for managing on the go it works fairly well.

      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Podio</strong>
      
      Podio’s incredibly handy for task management - the focus is very much on collaboration, with activity feeds playing a central role too. It’s free for up to five users, so you can set up workspaces, task management from the desktop version and then access it all from within the app.
      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podio/id404183617?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podio/id404183617?mt=8</a>
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Wrike</strong>
      
      Free for up to 5 users, Wrike’s mobile app is a nice way to manage tasks on projects and keep milestones visible to the whole team. It’s handy for discussing individual tasks with teammates, as well as keeping track of projects through the built-in discussion tool.

      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Zoho</strong>
      
      Zoho won a mention in our roundup of the best project management software here, so we’ll stick it into the mobile category for good measure. Actually, the app is pretty handy, with a Facebook-style feed of work that will feel very familiar to anyone addicted to their smartphone. Sharing and communicating is also pretty easy.

      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Teambox</strong>
      
      Officially a collaboration platform rather than a task management platform, Teambox is an impressive free app for up to five users. In a similar vain to our own task management solution, you can create tasks, assign people, set due dates and upload content. It works brilliantly on mobile.

      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>iScope2c</strong>
      
      Free for solo projects, iScope2c is all about managing projects and tasks, uploading files and checking them off when you’re done. It’s handy for anyone trying to manage their own thoughts or tasks in a logical way, although the people management options leave a little to be desired. A good taster for those getting started with project management on an iPad.
      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id486116463">https://itunes.apple.com/app/id486116463</a>
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Project Planning Pro</strong>
      
      We’re the kind of people who think Microsoft Project isn’t really the best solution for project management, but people seem wedded to it anyway. So this little app gets an honourable mention - you can import Microsoft Project plans and then export them back from iPad to PC in a jiffy.
