      Things are changing rapidly for the great and the good of the creative sectors. The world made famous by Donald Draper et al is continuing to change and their investment in technology is steadily increasing. Whilst many agencies saw 'sales' as a dirty word previously, no longer with Salesforce playing a key role in supporting the growth of commercial activities as well as ensuring that the work itself is delivered to a high standard. If you are in this space, you'll likely see that whilst creativity and great ideas are still of great interest to customers; they also want you to differentiate on their ability to get the right people on the right project at the right time!
      
      Through our work with Kantar, Omnicom and WPP - we see the best looking to build a reputation for creativity AND reliability.
