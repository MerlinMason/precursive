      The big news this week was the deadline for bids for Yahoo, with Verizon <a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/verizon-tops-pack-of-suitors-chasing-yahoo-1460939767-lMyQjAxMTI2MDE5ODAxMjg4Wj">tipped to be a strong contender</a> for the purchase. Yahoo revenues <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36086254">have fallen again</a> this quarter, and CEO Marissa Mayer <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/mayer-on-sales-process-2016-4">has come under fire</a> from sources that accuse her of failing to provide adequate answers.
      
      Google has also been in the press a lot this week. The European Commission has <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/europe-charges-google-with-antitrust-violations-over-android-2016-4">filed a formal antitrust complaint</a> against the Android over <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/alphabet-investors-not-worried-google-europe-anitrust-commission-android-battle-2016-4?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">accusations</a> it is using its dominant position to unfairly promote its products. Google has three months to respond.
      
      But it’s not all bad for Google – <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-has-more-logged-in-users-on-mobile-2016-4">CEO Sundar Pichai revealed</a> that it is moving towards being able to rival Facebook for user data thanks to the number of users who remain logged in on mobile, which will provide significant advertising advantages. Google has also <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/youtube-ads-have-better-roi-than-tv-according-to-google-2016-4">published a study</a> that found that advertising on YouTube is delivering a higher ROI than advertising on TV in 77% of cases – although this does not agree with previous research conducted by Thinkbox.
      
      And an article in Time this week has <a href="http://time.com/4303129/hackers-computer-ransom-ransomware/">reported on the ‘dramatic’ rise in ransomware attacks</a> over the past few years. The biggest challenge with these attacks is that once a computer has been taken over, there’s very little a user or law enforcement can do to counteract it. Victims often end up simply paying up, which of course just encourages hackers further. Prevention is the only cure: being on the look out for dodgy emails, avoiding file-sharing websites, backing up data regularly.
