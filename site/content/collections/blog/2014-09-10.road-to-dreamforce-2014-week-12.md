      Dreamforce is now less than three weeks away! This week's <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23roadtodf14">#roadtodf14</a> took a general overview of the campus, and Julie was joined by special guests Karin Flores and Michael Peachey to help point out what you can find where. This tied together a lot of what has been revealed in previous weeks when the team took a deep dive on the different elements of Dreamforce, such as the dev zone or marketing hub. As such, I'm sure you don't need reminding about what takes place in these area, and until Dreamforce release an updated map, describing their location is going to be tricky.
      
      Michael, however, had a very big announcement for this week: he revealed five of the six companies Salesforce are going to be using for their customer showcase! The sixth and final customer is going to announced at conference, but lets take a look at the other five.
      
      <strong>Verizon</strong>
      
      <a href="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Verizon-logo-big.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1701 size-thumbnail" style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Verizon-logo-big-150x150.png" alt="Verizon-logo-big" width="150" height="150" /></a>
      
      Verizon is one of the USA's four biggest telecommunications company, providing 97% of the American population with 4G LTE connectivity. "<span style="color: #414141;">Internal social networks can help big companies to break down communication barriers between their workers," says Laurie Shook of Verizon Communications. Verizon uses Salesforce Chatter to get its workers talking to one another, and has added a mobile component to allow its workers to chat, regardless of their physical location.

      <strong>E-Trade</strong>
      
      <img class="alignleft wp-image-1698 size-thumbnail" style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/etrade-logo-300x300-150x150.gif" alt="etrade-logo-300x300" width="150" height="150" />E-trade provides individuals with the platform, technology, and research to conduct financial transactions across global markets. <span style="color: #464646;">“We run our business on the Web, and it was vital that our CRM solution align with our model. Salesforce gives us lead management and reporting benefits with a seamless user experience that drives adoption and streamlines operations across our global sales teams.” (Source: Salesforce) </span>
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>Philips </strong>
      
      <img class="alignleft wp-image-1697 size-medium" style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/philips-300x112.jpg" alt="philips" width="300" height="112" />Philips is a company that needs no introduction, having been providing lighting, healthcare, and consumer lifestyle solutions for over a century. A global company, Philips are using Sales Cloud to give sales and operations employees real time customer insights, whether they're in China or Chile, making every interaction meaningful. Philips have also recently started using ExactTarget Marketing Cloud to listen to their customers on a daily basis, keeping their finger on the pulse, crucial for any consumer-centric company.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      <strong>General Electric</strong>
      
      <img class="alignleft wp-image-1700 size-thumbnail" style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/generalelectric-150x150.png" alt="generalelectric" width="150" height="150" />
      
      Founded by Thomas Edison in 1892, General Electric has always been on the cutting edge of technological advancements, and Salesforce is making sure that remains the case in the 21st century. GE first started using Salesforce to connect with commercial customers and manage opportunities, but they soon expanded to use Chatter for collaboration, and now ExactTarget is helping GE update their brand image and become more approachable to consumers through social media.
      
      <strong>Coca-Cola Germany</strong>
      
      <img class="alignleft wp-image-1699 size-thumbnail" style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Coca-Cola-150x150.jpg" alt="Coca-Cola" width="150" height="150" />
      
      You would be hard pushed to find a company with a stronger brand than Coca-Cola, but in the modern market, a company can no longer rely on its brand alone. Coca Cola Erfrischungsgetränke is using Salesforce wall-to-wall to expand their customer relationships and to maximise SAP data from their ERP systems to better manage those relationships.
      
      These are just some of the ways in which some of the world's largest companies are utilising Salesforce to drive their business forward. If you've found any of these intriguing, make sure you go and check out the customer showcases to find out more, as well as speak to representatives to get a real sense of how Salesforce is making a difference on a global scale. And don't forget, the 6th and final killer customer showcase will be revealed at conference!
