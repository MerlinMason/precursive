      After a gripping battle, Deep Mind’s AlphaGo conclusively beat Lee Se-dol at Go this week with a <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-03/15/alphago-deepmind-google-wins-lee-sedol">4-1 victory</a>. This groundbreaking step in the world of AI is leading many to speculate as to what the software will prove capable of next. Also in the world of artificial intelligence, Microsoft <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35778288">has revealed</a> that users will be able to develop AI software within its game Minecraft. The required software platform will be open source, creating a fantastic opportunity for amateurs to experiment with artificial intelligence on a new level.
      
      The Apple encryption debate rages on. Comedian John Oliver covered the topic in his regular <a href="http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver">Last Week Tonight</a> set, explaining why Apple’s reasons for refusal are legitimate. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com/us-govt-tells-apple-code-isnt-protected-by-the-1st-amendment-03-2016/">has disputed</a> Apple’s argument that computer code should be protected by the First Amendment. The hearing takes place this coming Tuesday, and we’ll be following the proceedings with interest.

      Instagram is following the likes of Facebook and Twitter by <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/instagram-will-start-ranking-photos-with-algorithm-2016-3">introducing a ranking algorithm</a> into its photo feed. The change will take a couple of months to implement, and, like <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/never-miss-important-tweets-from-people-you-follow">Twitter’s announcement last month</a>, has been met by backlash by users. This is hardly unexpected; even Facebook caused an outcry when it initially changed its feed several years ago. Social media users often react negatively to change, but it hasn’t cost platforms huge volumes of users – yet.
      
      Amazon is planning to follow in the footsteps of Mastercard by <a href="https://thestack.com/security/2016/03/15/amazon-wants-to-replace-passwords-with-selfies-and-videos/">introducing selfie authentication</a> to replace passwords. Everything we’re seeing in this area at the moment indicates a move away from traditional authentication to more biometric measures.
      
      And finally, Domino’s will soon be using <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/18/11259978/dominos-robot-pizza-delivery-trial">robots</a> to deliver pizza in New Zealand. The cute little guys can hold up to ten pizzas, which are unlocked by a code entered by the customer upon delivery.
