      Hello everyone
      
      I thought it important to share a few of the reasons why we are so delighted to announce the opening of Precursive Australia!
      
      + Good weather, great people
      
      + We are really fortunate to have an awesome MD of Australia, Marc Jarvis, who brings a huge amount of experience in professional services and the Salesforce ecosystem
      
      + After work beers, we hear that happens a bit :)
      
      + We get a lot of enquiries from Australia and those people wanted "boots on the ground"... consider our boots grounded
      
      + Salesforce are continuing to invest in the region and we want to support that
      
      + We hear from our customers that we provide a solution that creates a lot of long term value - we are confident it will help a wide range of companies in the region
      
      We are looking forward to the next chapter of Precursive's adventures and the new friends we'll make in a wonderful country.
      
      See you soon!
