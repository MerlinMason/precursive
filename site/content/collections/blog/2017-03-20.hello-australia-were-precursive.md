      Hello everyone
      
      I thought it important to share a few of the reasons why we are so delighted to announce the opening of Precursive Australia!
      
      + Good weather, great people
      
      + The stars aligned, we were really fortunate that our MD of Australia, Marc Jarvis was moving to the region so its great to have the business in such a safe pair of hands!
      
      + After work beers, we hear that happens a bit :)
      
      + We get a lot of enquiries from Australia and those people wanted "boots on the ground"... consider our boots grounded
      
      + Salesforce are continuing to invest in the region and have seen great growth and we want to support that
      
      + I might be biased but we have a great solution and are confident it will help a wide range of companies in the region
