      If you haven’t used <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> ('If This Then That'), you should check it out today. Essentially, it’s a smart way to connect the different tools we use every day - for example, you can connect software applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Gmail and Dropbox together even if they don’t have interfaces, link incoming emails to specific actions or set up an SMS number to do something specific when something else occurs.
      
      The basic building blocks of an IFTTT ‘recipe’ are the channels (the things you’re connecting) and a trigger, which determines when the recipe should take place. That’s a little abstract, so I’d suggest heading over to the <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes">IFTTT ‘recipe book’</a> which has tonnes of great examples. There are also mobile apps available for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635">Apple</a> iPhone/iPad users which help you to manage your recipes.

      <strong>Text to Google Drive</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/106670">https://ifttt.com/recipes/106670</a>
      
      A DIY-way of making mobile timesheets. Employees can simply text tasks and hours to a number, and it will save what’s been texted to a Google Drive spreadsheet. Have employees do it after every task and voila - you’ve got a timesheet that can be completed from anywhere. Also great for capturing expenses, feedback/ideas or any other line items that need to be captured on the go.
      
      <strong>Timesheet Alert (end of the month)</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/102184">https://ifttt.com/recipes/102184</a>
      
      Automates the sending of an SMS at the end of every month to remind employees to fill out their timesheets. Completely configurable (and easy to change from monthly to weekly as well).
      
      <strong>Give an email a green-check in Gmail, send it to Evernote</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/92673">https://ifttt.com/recipes/92673</a>
      
      Incredibly useful for making sure you’re following things up. This sends any email into Evernote at the click of a button, making it easy to find and access within your notebooks. Use it to keep client emails in one place or ensure important pieces of information are right at your fingertips.
      
      <strong>Schedule reminders to review starred emails</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/73800">https://ifttt.com/recipes/73800</a>
      
      Auto-creates events from starred emails, allowing you to quickly set Google Calendar reminders to follow up on certain messages.
      
      <strong>Add receipts &amp; orders to Receipt Spreadsheet
      </strong><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/124237">https://ifttt.com/recipes/124237</a>
      
      Instant expense collation! Simply forward an email, and this recipe will append it to a spreadsheet, collecting each one in place to be neatly filed with accounts later.
      
      <strong>Collect receipts in Dropbox</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/6366">https://ifttt.com/recipes/6366</a>
      
      If you’re sick of sifting through emails to find expense receipts, why not collect them all in one place on Dropbox and just receive an email notification when they’re uploaded? This recipe sends an automatic message as soon as anybody adds to a folder - just tell team members to upload to that folder and it will take care of the rest.
      
      <strong>Specific Gmail Sender to SMS</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/105239">https://ifttt.com/recipes/105239</a>
      
      Useful for forwarding important messages when email isn’t always accessible. All mails from specified addresses are automatically converted into a text message and forwarded instantly to ensure receipt.
      
      <strong>If new file in shared dropbox then email me</strong>
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/30994">https://ifttt.com/recipes/30994</a>
      
      Useful for tracking changes to project documents or files in Dropbox - simply enter the Dropbox activity RSS feed of the folder you want to track, and you’ll be notified by email as soon as anything changes in that folder.
