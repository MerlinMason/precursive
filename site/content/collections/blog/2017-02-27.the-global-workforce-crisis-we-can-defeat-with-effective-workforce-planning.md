      As we are sure you are aware of, there have been a countless number of articles and posts that aim at predicting what awaits us all in 2015. Therefore, first of all, you should know that this is not one of those posts but rather an inevitable truth that stems from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) analysis. The issue they have worked on affects everyone
      
      BCG predict that the future is doomed due to labour shortfalls that will result in potentially $10 TRILLION at risk. So in context, that’s the amount of total GDP that is concerned which is the equivalent of around 60% of today’s US GDP.  By 2020, many countries will still be experiencing a labour surplus, but by 2030 this surplus will have turned into a detrimental shortfall.
      
      BCG’s report has forecasts for 2020 and 2030 but in summary:
      
      <strong><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2012" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Global-Workforce-Crisis-NEW-ex6_inline_tcm80-164369.png" alt="Global-Workforce-Crisis-NEW-ex6_inline_tcm80-164369" width="460" height="654" /></strong></strong>
      <ul>
      <li>From the G8 countries alone, only the US and Russia will end up with a surplus. Not only will the US have a surplus of between 17.1 million people and 22 million people in 2020, but will still be fighting a surplus of at least7.4 million people by 2030.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>Countries that were left with a clear surplus by 2030 are South Africa, Saudi Arabia, USA, Russia, Argentina, Sweden and Turkey. The spread of countries geographically sprung a few recommendations to mind that we will offer in detail below.</li>
      </ul>
      This issue will become increasingly worse if it is continually neglected. Therefore, the real question is, how can we address the workforce crisis? What can be done to resolve this? Here’s what we think.
      
      <strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2015 size-medium" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/globe-skills-300x199.jpg" alt="globe skills" width="300" height="199" /></strong>
      
      <strong>Standardising Skills &amp; Outputs</strong>
      
      A more standardised skills-based economy could be a positive step in integrating different labour markets. By this, we mean there has to be international standards and skills implemented to therefore enable ‘skills trading’. We are continually finding that the modern day era is moving towards a skills economy and from conducting business with a number of very diverse service based organisations, we have seen the benefits of implementing this. For example, we had a freelance designer company in Belarus charging us the same rate as a designer in New York City. This then encourages better quality due to a standardised global price.
      
      <strong>Integrate Labour Markets</strong>
      
      We often find that businesses endure problems when trying to manage their workforce across a number of different countries and economies. From BCG’s research, it was clear to us that a recommendation could well be to integrate more labour markets both regionally and internationally. Interestingly there are countries in the same regions that are facing different issues so integrating these markets could help resolve all issues. From an international perspective, due to the wide geographical spread ofcountries that are left with a surplus in 2030, we thought that these countries could almost act as  ‘magnet’ economies that could integrate well with others in their own region, transitioning each others’ issues. Argentina and Brazil is a great example of this for example. From our own experience, we come across companies who regularly wish to integrate their labour capacity in order to create an internal marketplace.
      
      <strong>Skills: The New Currency</strong>
      
      Specific skills are becoming more and more important in economies now and so in that respect, skills are becoming the new currency which is part of a wider concept we like to call, ‘skills trading’. Nowadays, the customer tells us exactly what they need, who they need and most importantly which SKILLS they need. Which skills are important for your business? Which specific skills are critical for that specific role? These are the questions that will start to pioneer the future in terms of creating this visibility and Precursive is already ahead of the curve in adopting this view itself.
      
      Overall, there needs to be a system in place that gives you full visibility of different skill-sets, with the data being able to be pulled quickly and accurately. That’s where we specialise.
