      If you're comparing multiple providers for resource management software, it can be difficult to evaluate options, as not all solutions are like-for-like.
      
      This pre-programmed Excel checklist allows you to assign a value to your requirements and check that against how well each vendor meets or exceeds that requirement, to calculate an overall competency score.
      
      Some example requirements have been entered into the checklist, and there is space to add your own. If you'd like more suggestions for requirements to add to the list, check out our <a href="http://www.precursive.co.uk/resource-management-requirements-list/">resource management requirements list</a>.
