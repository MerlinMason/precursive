      Is there anything more nerve-racking than walking into a board meeting feeling unprepared? If you’re a resource manager, and you don’t have a complete set of timesheet data, you’ll more likely than not spend the majority of your time in front of the execs piecing together an estimation of resource utilization, based on the limited information you do have. Not only is this stressful for you, but it's also inefficient and not productive for your company.
      
      <a href="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-16.16.32.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-1569 size-medium" style="margin: 5px 0px 5px 20px;" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Screen-Shot-2014-07-18-at-16.16.32-300x183.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-18 at 16.16.32" width="300" height="183" /></a>Most companies we see who don’t get 100% timesheet completion use a combination of a manual system combined with some sort of spreadsheet entry. This sort of system most commonly breaks down because:
      <ul>
      <li>Filling in timesheet data is time consuming</li>
      <li>Manual systems are susceptible to human error</li>
      <li>People are human, and human’s forget</li>
      </ul>
      PSA solutions have been proven highly effective at eliminating these problems. They speed up timesheet completion by automating fields based on scheduling, thus helping to eliminate human error in the completion phase. In addition, being cloud-based, timesheets can be completed whether in or out of the office, and are automatically collected in a central database. Working in combination with automatic reminders, timesheets are done, not put off.
      
      So the result? 100% timesheet completion.

      But what does this mean when you’re standing in front of the CEO, trying to explain just what he’s getting from his biggest overhead? It means that you are able to confidently demonstrate exactly where the workforce is bringing in revenue on billable work, and what percentage of its time is spent on non-billable activities. This crucially allows you to work with the board to maximise the former and minimise the latter, working with reliable and accurate data, instead of spending your time sweating it out trying to paint a picture for them.
      
      The bottom line? 100% timesheet completion = less panicking and more profit.
