      I'm not from Mitch & Murray. I'm not from downtown. I didn't drive an $80,000 BMW to work.... it would be somewhat pointless as I work from home.
      
      However - like Blake from one of my favourite 80s movies, Glengarry Glen Ross by David Mamet - I would like to talk about something important. How. To sell. Effectively. In this world.
      
      Given the plethora of information out there about different approaches to sales, sale methodologies, buying behaviour, digital disruption, new sales hacks, sales automation tools and a like - we thought it would be nice to share some pragmatic perspective about how we observe the most progressive commercial minds approaching things.
