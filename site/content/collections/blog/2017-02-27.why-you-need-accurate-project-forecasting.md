      In any business, forecasting is important to survival. Stakeholders need numbers, HR needs hiring plans, and executives need to make sure they’re hitting their targets. But in professional services businesses, there’s another aspect to consider – project forecasting. With the need to plan ahead for projects and organise teams in advance, it’s important for businesses to have an accurate grasp of what projects are likely to fall, and when.
      
      <strong>What's particular to project-based businesses?</strong>
      
      ![CDATA[<img class="alignright wp-image-3611 size-medium" src="https://www.precursive.com/assets/media/Why-You-Need-Project-Forecasting-Edited-300x199.jpg"/>
      
      Professional services businesses need to forecast both capacity and revenue. Operations departments can use a combination of historical and projected data to predict the number and size of projects that will be sold in the future, and how much revenue and profit will be generated from them.
      
      <strong>Why is it important?</strong>
      
      Every business needs to be able to predict revenue and profits, and this can be difficult in a professional services organisation that depends on fluctuating project numbers.
      
      As for forecasting capacity – this is absolutely integral to forward planning and resource management. If you know that you’re going to be running a high number of large-scope projects in Q3, you need to make sure you’ve got the people available to man them. And recruiting the right talent takes time – the more prepared you are in advance, the better your team. It’s important to know where you’ll need to allocate your budget.
      
      <strong>What can go wrong?</strong>
      
      Upset investors, due to inaccurate revenue forecasting.
      
      Lost clients, thanks to not being able to get the right consultants on projects.
      
      Loss of profits, due to having to pay for expensive contractors rather than hire in-house.
      
      <strong>What can go right?</strong>
      
      When done well, your business will run smoothly. You know what to plan for and have already decided how to react. Your investors are happy with your accurate revenue predictions. Your clients are happy with the way their projects are being run. Your business grows, and everybody wins.
      
      <strong>Where can I learn more?</strong>
      
      So, aside from using resource management software, what can you do to ensure accurate project and revenue forecasting?
