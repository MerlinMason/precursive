      Every year the World Tour exceeds expectations, and this year looks set to be better than ever. With inspirational speakers including Sir Chris Hoy MBE, and Anne-Marie Imafidon, exciting breakout sessions to learn from, and a whole host of Success support and businesses to meet, there is plenty for anyone who works with Salesforce to get out of the day. Check out the event details and register <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/events/details/london/">here</a> if you haven't already!
