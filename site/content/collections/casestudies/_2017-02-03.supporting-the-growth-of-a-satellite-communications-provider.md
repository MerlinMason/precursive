      •	Operating in a global environment better alignment between sales activities and the field service organisation was needed to predict demand for engineering resources.
      •	Tracking of costs and expenses of projects was not sufficiently formalised and the goal was to remove the use of spreadsheets
      •	Global PMO needed a robust toolset to help run projects, resourcing and task management.
      •	Insufficient data and reporting for C-Level team for the global portfolio of projects.

Instead of using multi-platforms such as Salesforce, Excel Spreadsheets and MS Project to track projects the Precursive tool integrates all these features which enables the PMO to have visibility of all projects managed by project managers and able to provide specific reports for senior managers as well as the Precursive bespoke global charts view snapshot of project data.'
