      We worked closely with Precursive to build the model we wanted. Precursive gives us the ability to
      customise in any way we need. I loved the face-to-face, hands-on approach – it’s been a real
      differentiator for us, we’ve had great support and advice.

Previously, we had issues with users couldn’t log on, that had to be in a certain environment to log on… Precursive has taken all that way: users can fill out timesheets on the train'
