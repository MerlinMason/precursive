      PROBLEMS
      
      + Due to the rapid of growth of the business, it became increasingly difficult to understand the team’s availability and capacity for upcoming projects
      + People’s schedules were previously managed in a Google Sheet and administered by several members of the team
      + Difficult to see where upcoming gaps were in people’s calendars which should be focused on by the sales team
      + No way to track costs or margins in real-time and this required a lot of manual effort for the finance team to do so

      SOLUTION
      
      + Torrent needed an application that was native to Salesforce that would enable the alignment of sales activities with delivery resources through Salesforce
      + Staff needed to be able to record their time on their mobile device and also see upcoming projects easily
      + Given the breadth of Torrent’s technical knowledge across Salesforce products, it was important to be able to create a skills matrix in Precursive to help identify people’s expertise and knowledge for specific customer requirements
      + From a technical perspective, the solution needed to be simple to implement as Torrent would run the implementation themselves

      We looked at a number of options but Precursive stood out for a number of reasons given the quality
      of both functionality and user interface. Beyond that the team at Precursive has a deep knowledge
      and experience in consulting and the Salesforce ecosystem. This was critical in our thinking when
      looking for a long term partner to help us growth our business and continue to deliver meaningful
      change for our customers.
