  Precursive have well structured ways of working. We have a great partnership rather than them just
  being our supplier. We selected Salesforce as we loved the look of their marketplace for all the
  apps and therefore thought it is flexible and we could scale with it. With Precursive and Salesforce
  weâ€™re able to manage the whole customer lifecycle from lead through opportunity, resourcing,
  project, and cash.
