  **PROBLEMS **
  
  -Too much time to plan projects.
  -Lack of accurate time recording, and whether a project was running to budget.
  -All planning and reporting was done in Excel spreadsheets, which made maintaining up-to-date information difficult.
  -Static reporting which often featured out of date information.
  -Project Managers have to handle complex projects with frequent changes that was very difficult to maintain.

  Precursive is a good tool which works well; it’s a user-friendly system. We definitely have more
  visibility and clearer rotas now. The support team have been excellent – our requirements were
  very specific and put a lot of demand on them, and they’ve just been fantastic. I’d recommend
  them to anyone.
