      # Challenges
      
      Multiple systems used for resource management with no “single view of the truth”
      
      No clear view of capacity based on forecast and scheduled projects
      
      Consultants found submitting timesheets in Oracle to be time consuming
      
      Lack of reliable data or reporting
      
      
      # Solution
      
      Precursive provided a tailored solution with the ability to bring together forecasts and timesheets in one simple space that the entire team had access to, removing the need for consultants and managers to keep switching between the three separate systems.
      
      The solution featured:
      
      Resource Planning
      Capacity Planning
      Project Accounting
      Reporting
      Integration with existing Fujitsu Systems

      Timesheets are now submitted on a weekly basis using the Precursive platform, which automatically sends reminder emails to consultants and issues notifications of overdue timesheets.
      
      As Fujitsu already used Salesforce.com across the business, using a Salesforce.com partner like Precursive, which has based its software on the trusted and secure Force.com platform, substantially cut the implementation risk for the Company.
      
      # Results
      
      Consulting teams able to complete their timesheets in under a minute, delivering considerable productivity improvements across the workforce.
      
      Project managers now have access to integrated reporting with up-to-date information they can use to improve decision-making around resourcing in the business.
      
      Gaps in resourcing are visible months in advance with open positions filled quickly.
      
      Comprehensive reporting on key business metrics.

      > Consultants were able to control their own schedule of appointments, and as head of the team I was able to maintain control and visibility, giving me greater confidence in resourcing decisions and the ability to answer unexpected demands.
      
      Thanks to Precursive, gaps in resourcing are visible months in advance, and positions can be filled quickly in the event that a consultant suddenly becomes unavailable. To get immediate snapshots of Fujitsu’s resourcing position, Jefferd now runs regular reports:
      
      > Precursive provides one single view of the truth, within which running reports is a fast and painless process thanks to the simple interface, and regular automatic emails ensure that everyone involved in resource management is on the same page.
      
      > Precursive saved me lots of time creating and joining reports from different sources to gain a single view of the resourcing status. Manual handling errors were removed and availability of information was spread across the team more easily.
      
      > The team were professional, courteous and eager to tailor the solution to meet my specific needs. Precursive off ered great customer service.
