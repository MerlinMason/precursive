  "We liked the general feel and simplicity of Precursive. Implementation was smooth and the
  Precursive team were great, even though we had lots of customisation. We made a lot of requests
  which they worked out how to solve. I would recommend Precursive, especially for anybody using
  Salesforce – it definitely makes sense.”

      # Problems
      
      + Resource planning was run in a spread sheet, which was manually tracked by the VP of Operations.
      
      + Turning jobs down because of a lack of visibility of team capacity.
      
      + Payroll processing took a long time with weekly timesheets resulting in 150 Excel spreadsheets for accountants to go through.
      
      + Original systems lacked a defined, auditable approval process. Project managers not aware of what was being charged to their projects until it was too late.
      
      + Customers charged too much due to inaccurate time recorded on projects.

      As we struggled with the growing pains of a mid-sized company, we looked for a solution that was
      going to give us an auditable approval workflow and that could handle expense reporting. We were
      expanding the use of the Salesforce.com platform, and it became really critical that we had a
      connection between Salesforce and whatever system we were going to use. So as we looked at different
      alternatives, Precursive rose to the top.

      # Solution
      
      Precursive configured a solution with true workflow approval process as a priority. The end result was a customised solution with workflows designed to mirror Builtech’s existing processes.
      
      - Easy to use system adopted by users who were not traditionally friendly towards IT solutions.
      - Automatic generation of jobs on each user’s timesheet, so they could just input the numbers, hit submit, and go – on desktop, or on mobile.
      - Native integration with Salesforce, and so projects were automatically moved across to resource management after being won with up-to-date information on when projects would land and what resources they required
      - Financial data could then be reported on against sales data on the Salesforce platform.
      - Utilisation data to make informed resourcing and hiring decisions.

      With the Precursive link to Salesforce, Operations can see date changes before a project’s even
      sold, so we have more accurate information automatically. In the past, the lack of up-to-date
      information could have cost us a job that we could have accepted, but didn’t realise we had the
      resources for. Access to more timely information has assisted us in many ways to make informed
      decisions and manage our staff better.
