      # What the consultation will include
      
      Only a handful of speakers have been announced for Dreamforce 2016 so far, with philanthropy looking like the theme of the event. Interestingly, the first raft of speakers is predominantly female, with CEO Marc Benioff to be joined by Melinda Gates, Patricia Arquette, Billie Jean King and Deborah Duggan. Other speakers who have been announced include author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins and NASA astronauts Mark and Scott Kelly. We will update this article as more speakers are announced.
