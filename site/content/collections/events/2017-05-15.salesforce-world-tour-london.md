      # It’s back and better than ever.
      
      We’re thrilled to be co-sponsoring the official afterparty for Salesforce World Tour London, hosted by our friends at Make Positive and NewVoiceMedia.
      
      As Precursive are the experts in time management and productivity, we’ve snapped up 10 queue jumping passes! You will get fast-track entry and top-notch live entertainment!
      
      Last year's event was spectacular! Due to high demand, places at this year’s party will be invite-only and extremely limited.
