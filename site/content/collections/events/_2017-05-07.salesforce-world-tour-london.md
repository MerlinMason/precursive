      # It’s back and better than ever.
      
      We’re thrilled to be co-sponsoring the official afterparty for Salesforce World Tour London, hosted by our friends at makepositive and NewVoiceMedia.
      
      As Precursive are the experts in time management and productivity, we’ve snapped up 10 VIP passes! Our VIPs will get fast-track entry, top-notch live entertainment and access to an exclusive space with a private bar.
      
      Last year's event was spectacular! Due to high demand, places at this year’s party will be invite-only and extremely limited.
