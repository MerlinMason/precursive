      # It’s back and better than ever.
      
      We’re thrilled to be co-sponsoring the official afterparty for Salesforce World Tour London.
      
      Last year's event was spectacular! Due to high demand, places at this year’s party will be invite-only and extremely limited.
      
      However, as Precursive are the experts in time management and productivity, we’ve snapped up 10 VIP places. Our VIPs will get fast-track entry, top-notch live entertainment and access to an exclusive space with a private bar.
      
      Enter for your chance to win a VIP ticket to the party and see the line-up below.
