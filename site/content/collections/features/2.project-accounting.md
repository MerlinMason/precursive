  Companies find it difficult to know how a project is performing and when things are going wrong.
  Precursive Projects pull all the information for each project together into a simple, user-friendly
  interface. You can see the progress in real-time and if a project is on track against the budget,
  incurred expenses, or time planned to complete the work.
